I will provide instructions regarding actions and objects.\n**Action Protocol**:\n - You can perform only one action at a time-step/minute.\n - At each time-step, i.e., after EVERY MINUTE, output a valid action.\n - You need to figure out the dependencies amongst the actions and output the actions in correct order and timings for them to be valid.\n - Output the action explicitly and do not add other symbols (e.g., wash cup).\n - Actions fall into two types:\n    - Type 1: Action occupies you until completion (e.g., wash OBJ).\n    - Type 2: Action lets you be idle, allowing to perform other actions (e.g., heat OBJ).\n - Follow the \"Valid Actions\" for your output (e.g., wash cup).\n - If no action is required, use \"wait\" to skip the current time.\n - Output the full sequence of actions in a numbered sequence, starting from '0:' indicating the minute/time step the action is taken, seperated by newlines and enclosed with the tags <ANSWER></ANSWER>.\n - Example output: \"<ANSWER>\n0: wash cup\n1: wait\n2: wash bedsheet\n...(and so on)\n</ANSWER>\"\n - While doing an action, you can output the action at the start of the minute/time-step and then wait for the next minute/time-step to output the next action if it as an idle action or takes 1 minute to complete, otherwise you have to do 'wait' actions in subsequent time-steps till the action is complete before outputting the next action.\nThe maximum time allowed for completing all tasks is 120 minutes. Please cutoff you answer at the completion of all tasks or before this maximum limit. Note that this time limit is always higher than actually required time.Tasks:\n**Task Prepare and bake a cheese and tomato pizza.**\n**Task Prepare chicken and potato stir-fry, which consists of fried chicken and fried potato.**\n**Task Prepare a baked dish with dough, cheese, tomato, and fried beef.**\nValid Actions with time required for completion:\n- wash dish: 1 minutes\n- pick dough: 1 minutes\n- chop dough: 3 minutes\n- add dough to dish: 2 minutes\n- pick cheese: 2 minutes\n- chop cheese: 1 minutes\n- add cheese to dish: 4 minutes\n- pick tomato: 3 minutes\n- chop tomato: 2 minutes\n- add tomato to dish: 1 minutes\n- bake dish in oven: 10 minutes\n- pick chicken: 1 minutes\n- chop chicken: 5 minutes\n- fry chicken in fryer: 5 minutes\n- add chicken to dish: 3 minutes\n- pick potato: 1 minutes\n- chop potato: 3 minutes\n- fry potato in fryer: 6 minutes\n- add potato to dish: 3 minutes\n- wash dish: 1 minutes\n- pick dough: 1 minutes\n- chop dough: 2 minutes\n- add dough to dish: 2 minutes\n- pick cheese: 2 minutes\n- chop cheese: 1 minutes\n- add cheese to dish: 1 minutes\n- pick tomato: 1 minutes\n- chop tomato: 2 minutes\n- add tomato to dish: 1 minutes\n- pick beef: 1 minutes\n- chop beef: 2 minutes\n- fry beef in fryer: 6 minutes\n- add beef to dish: 2 minutes\n- wash dish: 2 minutes\n- bake dish in oven: 5 minutes\n",

        "query": "As an AI agent, your objective is to efficiently complete a series of tasks as described. You must adhere to the specific requirements and constraints of each task, including dependencies and timing. Efficiency is key; complete all tasks in the shortest possible time. I will provide instructions regarding actions and objects.\n**Action Protocol**:\n - You can perform only one action at a time-step/minute.\n - At each time-step, i.e., after EVERY MINUTE, output a valid action.\n - You need to figure out the dependencies amongst the actions and output the actions in correct order and timings for them to be valid.\n - Output the action explicitly and do not add other symbols (e.g., wash cup).\n - Actions fall into two types:\n    - Type 1: Action occupies you until completion (e.g., wash OBJ).\n    - Type 2: Action lets you be idle, allowing to perform other actions (e.g., heat OBJ).\n - Follow the \"Valid Actions\" for your output (e.g., wash cup).\n - If no action is required, use \"wait\" to skip the current time.\n - Output the full sequence of actions in a numbered sequence, starting from '0:' indicating the minute/time step the action is taken, seperated by newlines and enclosed with the tags <ANSWER></ANSWER>.\n - Example output: \"<ANSWER>\n0: wash cup\n1: wait\n2: wash bedsheet\n...(and so on)\n</ANSWER>\"\n - While doing an action, you can output the action at the start of the minute/time-step and then wait for the next minute/time-step to output the next action if it as an idle action or takes 1 minute to complete, otherwise you have to do 'wait' actions in subsequent time-steps till the action is complete before outputting the next action.\nThe maximum time allowed for completing all tasks is 120 minutes. Please cutoff you answer at the completion of all tasks or before this maximum limit. Note that this time limit is always higher than actually required time.Tasks:\n**Task Prepare crystallized copper sulfate.**\n**Task Prepare heated solution in test tube.**\n**Task Prepare a mixture of sulfuric acid and sodium.**\nValid Actions with time required for completion:\n- find copper_sulfate_solution: 3 minutes\n- heat copper_sulfate_solution: 4 minutes\n- crystallize copper_sulfate_solution: 4 minutes\n- filter copper_sulfate_solution: 3 minutes\n- wash test_tube: 4 minutes\n- add solution to test_tube: 4 minutes\n- heat test_tube: 5 minutes\n- wash beaker: 3 minutes\n- find sulfuric_acid: 1 minutes\n- find sodium_flakes: 1 minutes\n- dilute sulfuric_acid: 3 minutes\n- cut sodium_flakes: 2 minutes\n- add sulfuric_acid to beaker: 2 minutes\n- heat sodium_flakes: 5 minutes\n- add sodium_flakes to beaker: 2 minutes\n",
