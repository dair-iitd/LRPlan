        Given the requirements and the transportation options, we do have a transportation preference that it should not involve any flights, we would need either Taxi or Self-driving as the transportation options, we can take a self-driving from Evansville to San Angelo on day 1, and a self-driving from San Angelo to Wichita Falls on day 3. We can take a self-driving from Wichita Falls to Evansville on day 5.\n
        Given the requirements and the accommodation options, we do have an accommodation preference that it should be a private room and should permit children under 10, we would need an accommodation in San Angelo on day 1, day 2 and an accommodation in Wichita Falls on day 3, day 4, and we dont need accommodation on day 5 since we would be returning back home, now we can chose to stay at 'Beautiful home, San Angelo(Texas)' for day 1, day 2 and at 'Manhattan Club, Wichita Falls(Texas)' for day 3, day 4 as it abiding the accommodation preference as well as within the budget.\n
