Query: As an AI agent, your objective is to efficiently complete a series of tasks as described. You must adhere to the specific requirements and constraints of each task, including dependencies and timing. Efficiency is key; complete all tasks in the shortest possible time. I will provide instructions regarding actions and objects.\n**Action Protocol**:\n - You can perform only one action at a time-step/minute.\n - At each time-step, i.e., after EVERY MINUTE, output a valid action.\n - You need to figure out the dependencies amongst the actions and output the actions in correct order and timings for them to be valid.\n - Output the action explicitly and do not add other symbols (e.g., wash cup).\n - Actions fall into two types:\n    - Type 1: Action occupies you until completion (e.g., wash OBJ).\n    - Type 2: Action lets you be idle, allowing to perform other actions (e.g., heat OBJ).\n - Follow the \"Valid Actions\" for your output (e.g., wash cup).\n - If no action is required, use \"wait\" to skip the current time.\n - Output the full sequence of actions in a numbered sequence, starting from '0:' indicating the minute/time step the action is taken, seperated by newlines and enclosed with the tags <ANSWER></ANSWER>.\n - Example output: \"<ANSWER>\n0: wash cup\n1: wait\n2: wash bedsheet\n...(and so on)\n</ANSWER>\"\n - While doing an action, you can output the action at the start of the minute/time-step and then wait for the next minute/time-step to output the next action if it as an idle action or takes 1 minute to complete, otherwise you have to do 'wait' actions in subsequent time-steps till the action is complete before outputting the next action.\nThe maximum time allowed for completing all tasks is 40 minutes. Please cutoff you answer at the completion of all tasks or before this maximum limit. Note that this time limit is always higher than actually required time.Tasks:\n**Task Make a dish of beef fried rice, which consists of cooked rice and fried beef.**\nValid Actions with time required for completion:\n- wash dish: 3 minutes\n- pick rice: 2 minutes\n- pick beef: 2 minutes\n- cook rice in pot: 4 minutes\n- add rice to dish: 2 minutes\n- chop beef: 3 minutes\n- fry beef in fryer: 5 minutes\n- add beef to dish: 2 minutes\n
Plan: Let's think step by step. First, I will wash the dish. This will take 3 minutes. After that, I will pick the rice, which takes 2 minutes. Then, I will cook the rice in the pot for 4 minutes. While the rice is cooking, I can pick the beef, which takes 2 minutes. After picking the beef, I will chop it for 3 minutes. Once the beef is chopped, I will fry it in the fryer for 5 minutes. Finally, I will add both the rice and beef to the dish, which takes 2 minutes each. Now let's put this all together in a sequence of actions.\n <ANSWER>\n0: wash dish\n1: wait\n2: wait\n3: pick rice\n4: wait\n5: cook rice in pot\n6: pick beef\n7: wait\n8: chop beef\n9: wait\n10: wait\n11: fry beef in fryer\n12: add rice to dish\n13: wait\n14: wait\n15: wait\n16: add beef to dish\n17: wait\n</ANSWER>
